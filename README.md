# Overview

The hls_lfcd_lds_driver package is a driver for HLS(Hitachi-LG Sensor) LFCD LDS(Laser Distance Sensor). The LDS is a sensor sending the data to Host for the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Simultaneously the detecting obstacle data can also be sent to Host. HLDS(Hitachi-LG Data Storage) is developing the technology for the moving platform sensor such as Robot Vacuum Cleaners, Home Robot, Robotics Lawn Mower Sensor, etc.
